# DisneyPlus

* I'm a big fan from Disney. When i subscribeÂ´d in Disney+ service, i said for me, one day i'll recreate that. Obviously, is not perfect like the original, but i think this is pretty good!

* In this project, the technologies i used are:
  * [React](https://reactjs.org/)
  * [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/)
  * [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
  * [Swiper JS](https://swiperjs.com/)
